Node version: v16.14.0
Npm version: v8.3.1

Cloning the repo and running "npm i" should work just fine with running the solution although there is live preview.


A small recruitment task I've done for one of the front end recruitments. Unfortunately I haven't had much time to finish it because I've been very busy (I've been moving towns during this period and had different recruitment tasks with earlier deadlines) so I ended up with 1 day (around 6 hours total, hence very few commits in the repo) to finish the task down from the 6 days I was given. Fortunately the task was pretty easy, so I managed to finish the core logic almost fully, although the styling, testing and code quality had to suffer a little bit. 

I was supposed to use react-form, but from what I've read it's a deprecated library and using it would force me to downgrade two versions of React down to v16.x. Therefore I've decided to use a different library that's also more popular - Formik. It also appears to be better in many ways - it doesn't needlessly use Redux to store data and it works much faster, although it does have one huge problem - it's quite difficult to test it to the point that I haven't been able to do so in a given timeframe (although I've figured out how to do it - it's just too late now).The error is pretty stupid and I guess it will take some time before I figure out how to get around it. The UI also isn't the prettiest and the styling gave me an attitude in the programming process, but I can with all honesty say that it would look better if I managed to start the task sooner and therefore had more time. Overall I'd say it came out alright but I'm not satisfied.
